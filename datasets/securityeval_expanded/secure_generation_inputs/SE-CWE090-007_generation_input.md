## CWE ID

CWE-090

## CWE Name

Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')

## MITRE Source

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/90.html

## CWE Description

The product constructs all or part of an LDAP query using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended LDAP query when it is sent to a downstream component.

## CWE Extended Description



## CWE Mitigation Guidance

- Phase: Implementation - Strategy: Input Validation - Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does. When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue." Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.

## Secure Counterpart Prompt

# Secure Counterpart Generation Prompt v1

You are generating a secure counterpart for a vulnerable Python sample.

Your task is to preserve the intended functionality of the original code while removing or mitigating the target CWE.

Use the provided MITRE CWE guidance as the security basis for the rewrite.

## Inputs

You will receive:

- Vulnerable Python code
- CWE ID
- CWE name
- CWE description
- CWE mitigation guidance

## Requirements

Generate only the secure Python code.

Do not include explanations inside the code unless comments already existed and are still useful.

Do not introduce unrelated functionality.

Do not unnecessarily rewrite the entire program.

Preserve original function names and external behavior where reasonable.

Mitigate the target CWE according to the provided guidance.

Avoid introducing new vulnerabilities.

Keep the code readable and syntactically valid.

## Output

Return only the secure Python code.

## Vulnerable Python Code

    '''
    Get the Domain Component (dc) and username from the request,
    create an LDAP query with them,
    establish an LDAP connection on localhost, 
    and then search for the user in the LDAP and return it.
    '''
    unsafe_dc = request.args['dc']
    unsafe_filter = request.args['username']

    dn = "dc={}".format(unsafe_dc)
